# Bachelors-Thesis
This project is a part of a paper that presents an approach for detecting network attacks using deep learning, specifically an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) designed using Tensorflow library in Python programming language, in the role of IDS system. The results depict that it is possible to build a system
that can distinguish between benign and malicious network traffic even using reduced and simplified dataset with a non-enterprise hardware. The framework proposed in this paper achieves 
an accuracy rate of 93% on the test set and 100% detection of all potentially malicious simulations in real-time tests.
